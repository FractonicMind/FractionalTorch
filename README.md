# 🧠 FractionalTorch: A Paradigm Beyond Binary

### Where "How Much Yes" Replaces Binary Finality

## ✨ What Is FractionalTorch?

**FractionalTorch** is the first deep learning framework designed for **fractional computing** — a new paradigm where values are no longer binary approximations, but **exact rational numbers** in continuous space.

It brings **infinite nuance, mathematical purity**, and **graceful degradation** to AI systems.

Think of it as the first neural network system that answers not just *“yes or no”* — but *“how much yes?”*

## 🔬 Why Fractional Computing?

Binary computing was a hardware compromise.  
Fractional computing is **computational liberation**.

- ✅ Exact arithmetic (no floating-point drift)
- ✅ Learnable precision (networks decide how precise to be)
- ✅ Infinite density (information exists between every 0 and 1)
- ✅ Natural interpretability ("This weight is exactly 355/1130")
